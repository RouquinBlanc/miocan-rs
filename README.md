# Linux SocketCAN adapter for Metal IO

This is a quick and simple adapter for using 
[Metal I/O](https://github.com/carllerche/mio) with 
[socketcan](https://github.com/mbr/socketcan-rs) in order to get asynchronous
handling of CAN sockets.

This is really early stage.
Have a look at [this example](https://github.com/RouquinBlanc/miocan-example-rs)
for more info on usage.
